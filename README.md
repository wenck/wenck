### Hey there! 👋 I'm Will Zheng 

I'm a university student with a passion for AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). I'm fascinated by their ability to change how we interact with technology.  I'm currently putting that passion into action by developing an AI-powered video player.

Beyond the core AI work, I'm also expanding my skillset with MCP.

**My Tech Stack:**

*   Swift 📱
*   C/C++ ⚙️
*   Java ☕
*   HTML 🌐
*   Go (Currently Learning) 🐹

When I'm not coding, you'll likely find me singing 🎤. I'm an outgoing person who loves connecting with new people, so don't hesitate to reach out!
