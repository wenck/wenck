## About Me

Greetings! I'm a student majoring in CS based in 📍 Changchun, Jilin, China, with a deep passion for the intricacies of Artificial Intelligence, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). I'm currently immersed in developing an AI-assisted video player, aiming to redefine how we interact with visual content.

Beyond the core AI development, I'm actively exploring the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, a cutting-edge standard for connecting AI agents to external data sources and tools. This allows for a more seamless and powerful integration of AI into various applications.
